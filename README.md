# summer2020
We did some things!  Now we're on to summer2021 but going to still use this repo

# background reading

[Central dogma of molecular biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_dogma_of_molecular_biology) intro, Biological sequence information, General transfers of biological sequential information, Special transfers of biological sequential information (key to RNA-seq), Transfers of information not explicitly covered in the theory (especially Post-translational modification, methylation), 

[DNA sequencing background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing) intro, applications, Illumina (Solexa) sequencing, sample preparation, computational challenges, ethical issues

[RNA-seq background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-Seq) Intro, library prep, transcriptome assembly - guided, gene expression quantification, differential expression, applicatkons to medicine, large-scale sequencing efforts
* extra:  fusion gene detection

# 2021 
brainstormed list of things we could work on
* figure out how to load formatted heatmaps into Morpheus, write script
  * include clustered heatmaps so we can run clustering externally
* build heatmaps from arbitrary set of experiments
  * probably needs to have differential metadata generated
  * maybe add multiple layers i.e. logFc and adj.P.Value
* "fix" interactive Venn diagram tool
* script for geneBody coverage - make this part of the pipeline
* new GSEA script - use use command line GSEA?  investigate other options?
* run genewalk analysis on some sample data, build script to do so consistently
