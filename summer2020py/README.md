# python code used in various bioinformatics pipelines

# environment setup
TODO:  Andrew, can you keep track of everything we need to do to setup the environment here?
0. e.g. copy instructions for how to setup conda environment here (not conda itself, just the conda command)
0. the python python setup.py develop command
0. when we get to it the pip command to install the genepattern api
